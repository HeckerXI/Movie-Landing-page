                <p>Movie review:</p>
                <p>Anudeep KV's Jathi Ratnalu is not meant to be taken seriously and thatâ€™s made clear from 
                    the get go. It wastes no time getting into the thick of things, 
                    even before the titles roll and while it is a fun-rollercoaster ride with no time to lose, 
                    it makes one wonder if the film needed to be as long as it is 
                    to tell the almost non-existent story.</p>
